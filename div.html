      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>
        HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.
        It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website,
        so it's crucial to learn if you want to have a career in web development.
        In this article, I will walk you through what HTML is about in detail, how it does things on web pages, 
        and we'll also touch on a really cool part of HTML – Semantic HTML.

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
         This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
         enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, 
         which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

      <h2>Javascript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — 
        every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — 
        displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. 
        you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
